CHAPTER III.A PARABLE.

Then the venerable Sâriputra, pleased, glad, charmed, cheerful, thrilling with delight and joy,
stretched his joined hands towards the Lord, and, looking up to the Lord with a steady
gaze, addressed him in this strain:I am astonished, amazed, O Lord! I am in ecstasy to hear
such a call from the Lord.For when, before I had heard of this law from the Lord, I saw
other Bodhisattvas, and heard that the Bodhisattvas would in future get the name of Buddhas,
I felt extremely sorry, extremely vexed to be deprived from so grand a sight as the Tathâgata-knowledge.And
whenever, O Lord, for my daily recreation I was visiting the caves of
rocks or mountains, wood thickets, lovely gardens, rivers, and roots of trees, I always
was occupied with the same and ever-recurring thought:‘Whereas the entrance into the fixed
points [Or, elements] of the law is nominally equal, we have been dismissed by the Lord with
the inferior vehicle.’Instantly, however, O Lord, I felt that it was our own fault, not
the Lord's.For had we regarded the Lord at the time of his giving the allsurpassing demonstration
of the law, that is, the exposition of supreme, perfect enlightenment, then, O Lord,
we should have become adepts in those laws.But because, without understanding the mystery
of the Lord, we, at the moment of the Bodhisattvas not being assembled, heard only in
a hurry, caught, meditated, minded, took to heart the first lessons pronounced ori the law,therefore,
O Lord, I used to pass day and night in self-reproach.(But) to-day, O Lord, I
have reached complete extinction; to-day, O Lord, I have become calm;to-day, O Lord, I am
wholly come to rest;to-day, O Lord, I have reached Arhatship;to-day, O Lord, I am the Lord's
eldest son, born from his law, sprung into existence by the law, made by the law, inheriting
from the law, accomplished by the law.My burning has left me, O Lord, now that I have
heard this wonderful law, which I had not leant before, announced by the voice from the
mouth of the Lord.

And on that occasion the venerable Sâriputra addressed the Lord in the following stanzas:

1. I am astonished, great Leader, I am charmed to hear this voice; I feel no doubt any more;
now am I fully ripe for the superior vehicle.

2. Wonderful is the voice [Rather, call] of the Sugatas; it dispels the doubt and pain of living
beings; my pain also is all gone now that I, freed from imperfections, have heard that
voice (or, call).

3. When I was taking my daily recreation or was walking in woody thickets, when betaking myself
to the roots of trees or to mountain caves, I indulged in no other thought but this:

4. ‘O how am I deluded by vain thoughts! whereas the faultless laws are, nominally, equal, shall
I in future not preach the superior law in the world?

5. ‘The thirty-two characteristic signs have failed me, and the gold colour of the skin has
vanished; all the (ten) powers and emancipations have likewise been lost. O how have I gone
astray at the equal laws!

6. ‘The secondary signs also of the great Seers, the eighty excellent specific signs, and the
eighteen uncommon properties have failed me. O how am I deluded!'

7. And when I had perceived thee, so benigh and merciful to the world, and was lonely walking
to take my daily recreation, I thought: ‘I am excluded from that inconceivable, unbounded
knowledge!'

8. Days and nights, O Lord, I passed always thinking of the same subject; I would ask the Lord
whether I had lost my rank or not.

9. In such reflections, O Chief of Ginas, I constantly passed my days and nights; and on seeing
many other Bodhisattvas praised by the Leader of the world,

10. And on hearing this Buddha-law, I thought: ‘To be sure, this is expounded mysteriously';
it is an inscrutable, subtle, and faultless science, which is announced by the Ginas on the
terrace of enlightenment.'

11. Formerly I was attached to (heretical) theories, being a wandering monk and in high honour
(or, of the same opinions) with the heretics; afterwards has the Lord, regarding my disposition,
taught me Nirvâna, to detach me from perverted views.

12. After having completely freed myself from all (heretical) views and reached the laws of
void, (I conceive) that I have become extinct; yet this is not deemed to be extinction.

13. But when one becomes Buddha, a superior being, honoured by men, gods, goblins, Titans, and
adorned with the thirty-two characteristic signs, then one will be completely extinct.

14. All those (former) cares have now been dispelled, since I have heard the voice. Now am I
extinct, as thou announcest my destination (to Nirvâna) before the world including the gods.

15. When I first heard the voice of the Lord, I had a great terror lest it might be Mâra, the
evil one, who on this occasion had adopted the disguise of Buddha.

16. But when the unsurpassed Buddha-wisdom had been displayed in and established with arguments,
reasons, and illustrations, by myriads of kotis, then I lost all doubt about the law
I heard.

17. And when thou hadst mentioned to me the thousands of kotis of Buddhas, the past Ginas who
have come to final rest, and how they preached this law by firmly establishing it through
skilfulness;

18. How the many future Buddhas and those who are now existing, as knowers of the real truth,
shall expound or are expounding this law by hundreds of able devices;

19. And when thou wert mentioning thine own course after leaving home, how the idea of the wheel
of the law presented itself to thy mind and how thou decidedst upon preaching the law;

20. Then I was convinced: This is not Mâra; it is the Lord of the world, who has shown the true
course; no Mâras can here abide. So then my mind (for a moment) was overcome with perplexity;

21. But when the sweet, deep, and lovely voice of Buddha gladdened me, all doubts were scattered,
my perplexity vanished, and I stood firm in knowledge.

22. I shall become a Tathâgata, undoubtedly, worshipped in the world including the gods; I shall
manifest Buddha-wisdom, mysteriously rousing many Bodhisattvas.
